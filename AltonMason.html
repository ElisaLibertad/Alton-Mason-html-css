                        <p>Born to a former model mother and professional basketballer father who played overseas, Mason grew up in a number of countries,
                          including Belgium, Greece and his home base of Arizona, United States, before pursuing a future in acting and dancing at the
                          merican Musical Dramatic Arts Academy in Los Angeles in Los Angeles, at the age of 17.

                        In 2015, while he was still studying at the Academy, Mason was scouted via
                        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/altonmason/?hl=ru" target=«_blank»>Instagram</a>.
                        “I thought it was a joke,” he said in an interview with W magazine. “But then my agent
                        ontacted me through email and I saw all the confidentiality stuff and I knew it was real.”

                        <br>
                        Mason’s first major modelling gig was for Kanye West's Yeezy Season 2 collection at New
                        York Fashion Week in February 2016. The following year, he presented Gucci’s Cruise 2018
                        collection and was subsequently asked by Creative Director Alessandro Michele to appear in
                        the luxury house’s 2017 Pre-Fall campaign — a moment Mason has called the “highlight” of his career.

                        Since breaking into the modelling industry, Mason has walked for Heron Preston, 
                        Louis Vuitton and Off-White, and featured in magazines such as L'Officiel Hommes USA and V 
                        magazine, for which he appeared alongside Lizzo on the cover. He met the late Karl Lagerfeld 
                        during a campaign shoot for the designer’s namesake brand, where he was photographed by Lagerfeld
                        himself and scouted to walk in Chanel’s 2018/2019 Métiers d’Art show. Mason became the first black
                        male model to walk for the luxury house in its then 108-year history.</p>
